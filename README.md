## <u>Summary:</u>
## The purpose of this repo is to help you create a Windows Active Directory forest inside a VMware Workstation Pro environment on your Windows PC for your learning Active Directory (AD). The installation requires a considerable amount of RAM and Disk Storage:
## - A Windows PC with 32 GB of RAM is needed to run all the VMs
## - Disk space for all the VMs - Total 103GB minimum (Should be SSD based for responsiveness)
## -- Base Server2022 VM -> 11GB
## -- Base Win11 VM -> 12GB
## -- DC1 VM -> 10GB
## -- Management VM -> 25 GB
## -- WS01 VM -> 10GB
## -- Kali VM -> 35GB
## - Disk space for all the ISOs - Total 13.1GB minimum:
## -- Windows Server2022 ISO -> 5GB
## -- Windows 11 Enterprise Eval ISO -> 5GB
## -- Kali ISO -> 3.1GB
## The above are consided minimums as you are likely to add additional VMs (like WS02, Kali tools ...).
