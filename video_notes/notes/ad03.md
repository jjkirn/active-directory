# [POWERSHELL: Random Users & Weak Passwords (Active Directory #03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66ZD1J-AR2c)

## - In this video, a Powershell script (random_domain.ps1) will be created that generates a json file as output which contains random users, passwords, and groups for those users.
## - That script is run on the Management client to produce a file "out.json" that will be transfered to the Domain Controller (DC1).
## - On DC1 the "out.json" file will be input to a script we previously uploaded (gen_ad.ps1) to create those random users, passwords, and groups for the users on the DC1 Active Directory .
---
## Using the Management Client - move to code directory:
## - PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code>

## Create directory "data" and enter it:
## - PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> mkdir data
## - PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> cd data
## - PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code\data> 
## John creates the following files in the data directory:
## -- group_names.txt
## -- first_names.txt
## -- last_names.txt
## -- passwords.txt

## John used this [reference for names.](https://github.com/hippy2094/random-name-generator)
## - He used surnames.txt, firstnames.txt to create first_names.txt and last_names.txt

## John used this [reference for passwords.](https://github.com/roycwilliams/rockyou-top15k.txt)
## - He used this reference to create passwords.txt
---
## The final version of John's script (random_domain.ps1) is in [his github repo.](https://github.com/JohnHammond/active_directory/blob/main/code/random_domain.ps1)
## - However, he does not complete it until the next video.
---
## He reates two files (on Management Client)
## -- random_domain.ps1 - Powershell script to create many random users, passwords, and groups for the users
## -- out.json - the output of the "random_domain.ps1" script

## Run the script "random_domain.ps" to output a json file like "out.json"
## The out.json file contains the generated random users, passwords and user groups in json format:
## - PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> .\random_domain.ps1
## - OutputJSONFile: out.json
---
## Using the Management client, transfer these files to DC1:
## - PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> Copy-Item out.json $dc C:\Windows\Tasks
## - PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> Copy-Item gen_ad.ps1 $dc C:\Windows\Tasks
## Enter session on DC1:
## -PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> Enter-PSSession $dc
## On the DC1 session run the following to create the random users on the DC1 Active Directory:
## - [192.168.175.155] PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> cd C:\Windows\Tasks
## - [192.168.175.155] PS C:\Windows\Tasks>
## - [192.168.175.155] PS C:\Windows\Tasks> .\gen_ad.ps1 .\out.json
---
## NOTE: John's original version of the "random_domain.ps1" created "out.json" that produced errors at this point due to security policy issues which he fixes in the next video.
## So, if you download the "random_domain.ps1" script from John's github - all is now fixed.
---
## You should now have a "bunch" of new random users, groups, passwords on DC1 Active Directory
## You can view them via:
## -- [192.168.175.155] PS C:\Windows\Tasks> Get-ADUser -Filter *
## -- [192.168.175.155] PS C:\Windows\Tasks> Get-ADGroup -Filter *

## In the next video, John shows us how to easily remove all the users we created by using an paramter on the gen_ad.ps1 script.
