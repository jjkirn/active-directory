# [Automating DOMAIN USERS (Active Directory #02) - video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VqS6wMn6w)
In the previous video, three VMs were created and a snapshot was created for each:
- DC1 - Windows Server 2022 clone - Active Directory Domain Controller (DC1)
- Management - Windows 11 Enterprise clone - Management Client
- WS01 - Windows 11 Enterprise clone - Workstation 01 - computer joined to our Domain Controller - DC1
---
In this video, several Powershell scripts and json files will be used to create users on the DC1.

### John mentioned he used a repo ["vulnerable-AD"](https://github.com/WazeHell/vulnerable-AD) as a reference to create the scripts.
---
First lets show how to transfer files from the "Management" client to DC1:
- Login to Management client as local_admin
- Open Terminal session as administrator and clone John's active-directoy repo:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory> git clone https://github.com/JohnHammond/active_directory.git
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory> cd code
```
- Assign variable $dc to a new logon session to DC1
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> $dc = New-PSSession -ComputerName 192.168.175.155 -Credential (Get-Credential)
```
- A login popup will appear -> enter the DC1 credentials 
```
xyz\Administrator:P@ssw0rd123!
```
- We can now copy file from the Management Client to the DC1 via:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> Copy-Item .\ad_schema.json -ToSession $dc C:\Windows\Tasks
```
---
- We can now enter a session to DC1 to see if file made it:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> Enter-PSSession $dc
```
- We now have a session to DC1
```
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents>
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> cd C:\Windows\Tasks
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Windows\Tasks>
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Windows\Tasks> dir
```
- You should see the file we transfered (ad_schema.json)
---
- John created several files in the code directory that we will move to DC1, we already moved ad_schema.json, we need to move gen_ad.ps1
- Start by temporarily closing our session to DC1:
```
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Windows\Tasks> Exit-PSSession
```
- Should be back to Management client
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code>
```
- Follow these steps to move the gen_ad.ps script to DC1:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> Copy-Item gen_ad.ps1 $dc -ToSession C:\Windows\Tasks
```
- Go back into session with DC1:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> Enter-PSSession $dc
```
- Should now be in a session to DC1:
```
[192.168.175.155] PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents>
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> cd C:\Windows\Tasks
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Windows\Tasks>
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Windows\Tasks> dir
```
- You should now have both gen_ad.ps and ad_schema.json at this location
---
- Time to run the file gen_ad.ps1 to create the users and groups listed in the ad_schema.json file:
```
[192.168.175.155] PS C:\Windows\Tasks> .\gen_ad.ps1
```
- It prompts for a JSONFile -> enter .\ad_schema.json
```
JSONFile: .\ad_schema.json
```
- You should now be able to run the following in Powershell on DS1 to see all the newly created users and groups:
```
Get-ADUser -Filter *
Get-ADGroup -Filter *
```
- Worked great on DS1 !
---
- However, when I logged in to WS01 as user alice, password bubbles I could not run either of the following Powershell commands:
```
Get-ADUser -Filter * 
Get-ADGroup -Filter *
```
---
- I determined that I had to install [Remote Server Administrator Tools (RSAT)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/system-management-components/remote-server-administration-tools) on WS01 for this to work.
- I had to logoff as "xyz\alice" and login as "DESKTOP-WS01\local_admin" to do the RSAT Install.
- I used the GUI method as listed this reference - [Ref](https://www.itechtics.com/rsat-tools-windows-11/).
- After the install of the selected RSAT Features finished, logoff the local_admin and log back in as "xyz\alice"
- Now able to run the GetADuser and GetADGroup commands as alice !!!

- Power off WS01
- Take a snapshot -> label it "RSAT tools installed"
