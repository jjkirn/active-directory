# [Automating DOMAIN USERS (Active Directory #02) - video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VqS6wMn6w)
In the previous video, three VMs were created and a snapshot was created for each:
- DC1 - Windows Server 2022 clone - Active Directory Domain Controller (DC1)
- MGT - Windows 11 Enterprise clone - Management Client
- WS1 - Windows 11 Enterprise clone - Workstation 1 - computer joined to our Domain Controller - DC1
---
In this video, several Powershell scripts and json files will be used to create users on the DC1.

#### John mentioned he used a repo ["vulnerable-AD"](https://github.com/WazeHell/vulnerable-AD) as a reference to create the scripts.
---
First lets show how to transfer files from MGT to DC1:
- Login to MGT as local_admin
- Open Terminal session as administrator and clone My active-directoy repo:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\> git clone https://github.com/jjkirn/active-directory.git
PS C:\Users\local_admin\> cd active-directory\code
```
- Assign variable $dc to a new logon session to DC1
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> $dc = New-PSSession -ComputerName 192.168.175.155 -Credential (Get-Credential)
```
- A login popup will appear -> enter the DC1 credentials 
```
xyz\Administrator:P@ssw0rd123!
```
- We can now copy file from MGT to the DC1 via:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> Copy-Item .\ad_schema.json -ToSession $dc C:\Windows\Tasks
```
---
- We can now enter a session to DC1 to see if file made it:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> Enter-PSSession $dc
```
- We now have a session to DC1
```
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents>
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> cd C:\Windows\Tasks
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Windows\Tasks>
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Windows\Tasks> dir
```
- You should see the file we transfered (ad_schema.json)
---
- John created several files in the code directory that we will move to DC1, we already moved ad_schema.json, we need to move gen_ad.ps1
- Start by temporarily closing our session to DC1:
```
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Windows\Tasks> Exit-PSSession
```
- Should be back on MGT
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code>
```
- Follow these steps to move the gen_ad.ps script to DC1:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> Copy-Item .\gen_ad.ps1 -ToSession $dc C:\Windows\Tasks
```
- Go back into session with DC1:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> Enter-PSSession $dc
```
- Should now be in a session to DC1:
```
[192.168.175.155] PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents>
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> cd C:\Windows\Tasks
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Windows\Tasks>
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Windows\Tasks> dir
```
- You should now have both gen_ad.ps and ad_schema.json at this location
---
- Time to run the file gen_ad.ps1 to create the users and groups listed in the ad_schema.json file:
```
[192.168.175.155] PS C:\Windows\Tasks> .\gen_ad.ps1
```
- It prompts for a JSONFile -> enter .\ad_schema.json
```
JSONFile: .\ad_schema.json
```
- You should now be able to run the following in Powershell on **DS1** to see all the newly created users and groups:
```
Get-ADUser -Filter *
Get-ADGroup -Filter *
```
- Worked great!

- You won't be able to created a remote session from WS1 or WS2 to DC1 and run the Get-ADUser and Get-ADGoup commands because they are not using WINRM and are not a trusted host.

- **Only MGT has WINRM enabled and is a trusted host!**
