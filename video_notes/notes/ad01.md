# [ACTIVE DIRECTORY #01 Joining a HOME LAB Domain (Active Directory #01) - video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19pNfFnBfI8)
In the previous video, two "base VMs" were created and a snapshot was created for each.

In this video, clones of these base VMs will be created to produce:
- the AD Domain controller (DC1) VM
- the Management (MGT) client VM
- the Domain workstations (WS1, and possibly WS2)
---
1. Using our "Base Server 2022" VM we will create our Domain Controller (DC1)
- Clone "Base Server 2022", call it DC1
- Power it on, Log in
- Select option to go to Powershell
- Should see the following prompt 
```
PS C:\Users\Administrator>
```

---
2. Begin Configuration of DC1
- On DC1, if in Powershell go back to the sconfig screen via:
```
PS C:\Users\Administrator> sconfig.exe
```
- Use the menu option (2) to change the computer name to "DC1"
- Use the menu option (8) to change the IP to static IP -> I used 192.168.175.155
- Use the menu option (8) then (1) to change the DNS primary IP to 192.168.175.155
- Reboot
---
3. DC1 configuration for Active Directory - [Ref-1](https://woshub.com/windows-server-core-install-active-directory-domain-controller/)
- This step will install ["AD-Domain-Services and Management Tools"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview) and Create an "AD Forest"
- If in sconfig, enter Poweshell via option (15), should see:
```
PS C:\Users\Administrator>
```
- Enter the following commands to perform the install:
```
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Install-WidowsFeature -name AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Import-Module ADDSDeployment
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Install-ADDSForest
DomainName: xyz.com
SafeModeAdministratorPassword: P@ssw0rd123!
Confirm SafeModeAdministratorPassword: P@ssw0rd123!
Y
```
- Reboot
---
However, the reboot defaults to resetting the DNS server to 127.0.0.1, we must fix this
- If in sconfig, enter Poweshell via option (15), should see:
```
PS C:\Users\Administrator>
```
- Get DNS address:
```
PS C:\Users\Administrator > Get-DNSClientServerAddress
```
- Should see 127.0.0.1, we need to fix this
- Get InterfaceIndex:
```
PS C:\Users\Administrator > Get-NetIPAddress -IPAddress 127.0.0.1
```
- For me the output was [InterfaceIndex = 4]
- OK, now time to put in the correct DNS IP:
```
PS C:\Users\Administrator > Set-DNSClientServerAddress -InterfaceIndex 4 -ServerAddresses 192.168.175.155
```
- Verify It got set correctly:
```
PS C:\Users\Administrator > Get-DNSClientServerAddress
```
- Should see 192.168.175.155
- Shut down
- Take a snapshot -> name it "AD configured and WMware Tools"
---
---
4. Using our "Base Win11" VM we will create our Management Client VM (MGT)
- Clone "Base Win11" VM, call it MGT
- Power it on, Log in as "local_admin"
- Open Terminal as Administrator, should see:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin>
```
- Get the current host name, it is likely not what we want
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin> hostname
```
- Change it to the hostname we want - MGT
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin> Rename-Computer -NewName "MGT"
```
- Set the Static IP address, Default Gateway and DNS for MGT
```
netsh interface ip set address name="Ethernet0" static 192.168.175.35 255.255.255.0 192.168.175.2
netsh interface ip set dns name="Ethernet0" static 192.168.175.155
```
- Start WinRM service:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin> Start-Service WinRM
```
- Check if there are any "Trusted Hosts":
```
 PS C:\Users\local_admin> ls wsman:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts
```
- There shouldn't be any hosts listed yet
- Set the DC1 as a "Trusted Host":
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin> set-item wsman:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -value 192.168.175.155
```
- You can re-run the check for "Trusted Hosts" again to confirm all is well:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin> ls wsman:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts
```
- Should see our DC1 IP as 192.168.175.155
---
Let's install ["chocolately"](https://chocolatey.org) to provide an easy way to install other tools.
- To install it enter:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```
- Now can use choco to install other tools
- Let's install git:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin> choco install git
```
- Let's install Visual Studio Code:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin> choco install vscode
```
- Verify you can connect to the AD server
```
Enter-PSSession 192.168.175.155 -Credential(Get-Credential)
```
Enter "Administrator" and "Password" and should see a login to the AD:
```
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents>
```
- Great it worked ! - type exit to leave session
- Power it off
- Take a snapshot -> name it "Trusted host + Tools"
---
---
5. Using our "Base Win11" VM we will create our Workstation VM (WS1)
- Clone "Base Win11" VM, call it "WS1"
- Power it on, Log in as "local_admin"
- Open Terminal as Administrator, should see:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin>
```
- Get the current host name, it is likely not what we want
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin> hostname
```
- Change it to the hostname we want - WS1
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin> Rename-Computer -NewName "WS1"
```
- Set the Static IP address, Default Gateway and DNS for WS1
```
netsh interface ip set address name="Ethernet0" static 192.168.175.31 255.255.255.0 192.168.175.2
netsh interface ip set dns name="Ethernet0" static 192.168.175.155
```
- Verify all items were set correctly
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin> ipconfig /all
```
- DNS address should now be set to 192.168.175.155, IP should be 192.168.175.31
---

Now it is time to join (WS1) to the Domain (DC1) via Powershell:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin > Add-Computer -DomainName xyz.com -Credential xyz\Administrator -Force -Restart
```
- Should see a popup to login
- It should reboot -> Success !!!
- Power off
- Take a snapshot -> label it "DC1 joined"
---
### NOTE: if you wanted to create a "WS2" just follow the steps in 5. replacing WS2 for WS1.

MY ADDENDUM ON STATIC IPs
---
To make it easier,  I created static IPs for all the LAB VMs:
- DC1:  192.168.175.155 (done during configuration)
- WS1:  192.168.175.31
- WS2:  192.168.175.32
- MGT:  192.168.175.35
- KALI: 192.168.175.30

You can see the four ways to set static IPs at: [Windows 11: Set a static IP address (all the ways - 4)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ4acV76XPc)

I used Windows Terminal to set IP, Default Gateway and DNS for Windows 11 based installs:

- MGT:
```
netsh interface ip set address name="Ethernet0" static 192.168.175.35 255.255.255.0 192.168.175.2
netsh interface ip set dns name="Ethernet0" static 192.168.175.155
```

- WS1:
```
netsh interface ip set address name="Ethernet0" static 192.168.175.31 255.255.255.0 192.168.175.2
netsh interface ip set dns name="Ethernet0" static 192.168.175.155
```

- WS2:
```
netsh interface ip set address name="Ethernet0" static 192.168.175.32 255.255.255.0 192.168.175.2
netsh interface ip set dns name="Ethernet0" static 192.168.175.155
```
