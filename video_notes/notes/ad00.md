# [ACTIVE DIRECTORY #00 Creating our Server + Workstation Virtual Environment - video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKtDQtsubio)
## <b>GENERAL WARNING:</b>
Before you start, be aware that you will need a PC that has a lot of RAM - mine has 32GB and it was just enough for this LAB. I am not sure if you could setup this lab with 16GB RAM !!! The Windows VMs take alot of RAM, and you will need to create at least 3 Windows VMs.
## <b>Download Microsoft EVAL ISOs:</b>
Start by downloading the ISOs for the Windows products used in this lab:
- You will need to download a [Windows Server 2022 Eval ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022)
- You will also need to download a [Windows 11 Enterprise Eval ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-11-enterprise)
---
## <b>NOTE:</b>
### The lab environment is based on VMware Workstation Pro - I have not tried using Virtual Box.
### Also, the latest version of VMware Workstation Pro (17.6.3) now automatically supports and creates a TPM2.0 storage device for Windows 11 OS.
### You now no longer need a "TPM Bybpass" to install from iso.

## There are several Base VMs to be created:
1. Base Server 2022 VM (revised 3.10.25)
- Disk: 100 GB
- RAM: 4 GB
- Processors: 2 Cores: 1
- CD: (Windows Server 2022 Eval ISO file)

2. Base Win11 VM
- Disk: 80 GB
- RAM: 4 GB
- Processors: 2 Cores: 1
- CD: (Windows 11 Enterprise Eval ISO file)

## Booting into VMs
Start on WMWare Workstation, create a folder: Base Templates

1. Base Server 2022 VM
- Create a new VM called "Base WinServer 20222" in folder "Base Template" using the above specifications
- Power on the VM
- Select Windows Server 2022 Standard Eval (server core)
- It may restart a few times
- Set password "P@ssw0rd123!"
- Use Sconfig.exe
    - Install Updates (6)
    - All quality Updates (1)
    - Exit to PS command line (15)
- On othe top of VMware Workstation menu bard "select VM->Install VMware tools" for this VM then use the following PS commands to install
- Install VMtools from PS command line:
```
PS C:\Users\Administrator> cd D:
PS D:\> dir
PS D:\> .\setup64.exe
```
- A "VMware Tools Setup" popup window should launch, Click on "Next>"
- A "Choose SetupType" popup window should launch, Select "Typical" then Click on "Next>"
- A "Ready to Install VMware Tools" popup should launch, Click on "Install"
- A "Completed VMware Tools Setup Wizard" popup should launch, Click on "Finish"

- A "VMware Tools Setup" popup should launch asking you to "restart", click "Yes"
- Once the reboot completes, use the Sconfig menu to select PS command line and run the following to shut down:

```
PS C:\Users\Administrator> shutdown /s /t 0
```
- Take a Snapshot -> label it "Fresh Install"


2. Base Win11 VM
- Power on the VM
- It will prompt you to select a login method
- Under "Sign-in options" make sure to select "Domain join instead"
- For "Enter your name:" use local_admin 
- For "Enter a passowd:" use P@ssw0rd
- It will then ask three Security questions:
    - What was your first pet's name? "blah"
