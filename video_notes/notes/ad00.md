# [ACTIVE DIRECTORY #00 Creating our Server + Workstation Virtual Environment - video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKtDQtsubio)
## <b>GENERAL WARNING:</b>
Before you start, be aware that you will need a PC that has a lot of RAM - mine has 32GB and it was just enough for this LAB. I am not sure if you could setup this lab with 16GB RAM !!! The Windows VMs take alot of RAM, and you will need to create at least 3 Windows VMs.
## <b>Download Microsoft EVAL ISOs:</b>
Start by downloading the ISOs for the Windows products used in this lab:
- You will need to download a [Windows Server 2022 Eval ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022)
- You will also need to download a [Windows 11 Enterprise Eval ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-11-enterprise)
---
## <b>NOTE:</b>
### The lab environment is based on VMware Workstation Pro - I have not tried using Virtual Box.
---
## There are several Base VMs to be created:
1. Base Server 2022 VM
- Disk: 100 GB
- RAM: 8 GB
- Processors: 4 Cores: 1
- CD: (Windows Server 2022 Eval ISO file)

2. Base Win11 VM
- Disk: 80 GB
