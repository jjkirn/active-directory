# [TEARING DOWN the DOMAIN CONTROLLER (Active Directory #04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8o6zEngpjk)
In this video John fixed the errors produced by "random_domain.ps1" script related to security policy issues he encountered in the previous video.

#### <b>REMINDER:</b> If you download the "random_domain.ps1" script from [John's github](https://github.com/JohnHammond/active_directory/blob/main/code/random_domain.ps1) - all is now fixed.  Our assumption is that we are using this "fixed" version going forward.
---
Start by Loggin into DC1 to get the security configuration:
```
PS C:\Users\Administrator> secedit /export /cfg C:\Windows\Tasks\secpol.cfg
```

#### Notice that "Min_Password_Length" = 7 in secpol.cfg file.
#### John's updated "gen_ad.ps1" script sets it to "1".
#### We are using the fixed version of "random_domain.ps1"

Using the Management Client, Login as "local_admin"
Move to code directory:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code>
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory> $cred = (Get-Credential)
```
Create new session to DC1:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory> $dc = New-PSSession 192.168.175.155 -Credential $cred
```
Move to code directory:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory> cd .\code\
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code>
```
Run the "random_domain.ps1" script to get our json file:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> .\random_domain.ps1
OutputJSONFile: out.json
```
Copy the "out.json" and "gen_ad.ps1" script to DC1:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> Copy-Item .\out.json -ToSession $dc C:\Windows\Tasks
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> Copy-Item .\gen_ad.ps1 -ToSession $dc C:\Windows\Tasks
```
Enter session to be on DC1:
```
PS C:\Users\local_admin\active_directory\code> Enter-PSSession $dc
```
---
Now in a session to DC1:
```
[192.168.175.155] PS c:\Users\Administrator\Documents>
```
Move to Tasks directory:
```
[192.168.175.155] PS c:\Users\Administrator\Documents> cd C:\Windows\Tasks
[192.168.175.155] PS C:\Windows\Tasks>
```
Create the random users based the "out.json" file contents:
```
[192.168.175.155] PS C:\Windows\Tasks> .\gen_ad.ps1 .\out.json
```
#### The script should run without any errors!
#### You should now have a "bunch" of new random users, groups, passwords on DC1 Active Directory.
---
Power on WS01:
- Try to login as one of the random users we just created (abrown) on DC1
- It worked !!!
- Open PowerShell terminal:
```
PS C:\Users\abrown>
PS C:\Users\abrown> net user /domain
```
- You should see a long list of all the users the script created !!!
- Power off WS01
---
This is where we use the -Undo option to remove all our previous users.

Switch to Management Client and in session to DC1.

Run the below to remove all users:
```
[192.168.175.155] PS C:\Windows\Tasks> .\gen_ad.ps1 .\out.json -Undo
```
Verify all the users that we created are now all gone:
```
[192.168.175.155] PS C:\Windows\Tasks> net user /domain
```
Should only see:
```
Administrator Guest krbtgt
```
Verify the created groups are gone:
```
[192.168.175.155] PS C:\Windows\Tasks> net group /domain
```
#### It works !!!
