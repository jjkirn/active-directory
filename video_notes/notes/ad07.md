# [POWERSHELL - Automating RANDOM Local Admins (Active Directory #07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIXTPpluHVo)
In this video John attempts to update two of the Powershell scripts (gen_ad.ps1 and random_domain.ps1) he already created to support optional parameters such as:
-UserCount
-GroupCount
-LocalAdminCount

There aren't any steps to document in this writeup as they are just intermediate.

Near the end of the video, John has to update the "gen_ad.ps1" to take advantage of the new "LocalAdminCount" changes.

However, he stops at only making the users local_admins on on the Domain controller but not on any workstation.

He tries to finalize the changes in the next video.
