# [Active Directory PowerShell #08 Generating Local Admins across Hosts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhBJrWUb57o)
In the previous video, John updated two of the Powershell scripts (gen_ad.ps1 and random_domain.psa) to create "local_admin".
However, you had to run these scipts from the Doman controller.

At this point, all workstations (WS01, WS02) have thier name set to (WS01, WS02) and are domain joined.

We pick up the notes at 4:15 in the video, where he does the remove all Domain users from the Managemement computer
```
[192.168.175.155] PS C:\Windows\Tasks> .\gen_ad.ps1 .\out.json -Undo
```

He tries to run a scrptblock on ws01
```
[192.168.175.155] PS C:\Windows\Tasks> Invoke-Command -Computer ws01 -ScriptBlock { whoami}
```
It fails

He tries to ping ws01 
```
[192.168.175.155] PS C:\Windows\Tasks> ping ws01
```
Ping request could not find host ws01. Please check the name and try again.

Tries the default computer name
```
[192.168.175.155] PS C:\Windows\Tasks> ping DESKTOP-L31M0v1
Pinging desktop-l31mov1.xyz [192.168.111.140] with 32 bytes of data:
Request timed out.
```
---
He decides the delault names are anoying and tries to change them to our Worktation names (WS01, WS02, ...)

He spends about 26 minutes finally getting both Work Station names set to "ws01" and "ws02" from the default style of "DESKTOP-XXXXXXX" and to be domain joined.

Back on the Management computer with the session to DC1
```
[192.168.175.155] PS C:\Windows\Tasks> Get-ADcomputer -Filter *
```
It does show the computer correctly as WS01

Switch back to WS01 
reboot it

Back on Management computer:
```
[192.168.175.155] PS C:\Windows\Tasks> Invoke-Command -Computer ws01 -ScriptBlock { ipconfig }
```
It fails - maybe because of trust relationship

Switch back to WS01: (at about 8:30 in the video)
```
PS C:\Windows\local_admin>
```

Enable PS Remoting
```
PS C:\Windows\local_admin> Enable-PSRemoting
PS C:\Windows\local_admin> get-item wsman:\localhost\client\trustedhosts
```
It shows no trusted computers

Add the domain computer to trustedhosts
```
PS C:\Windows\local_admin> set-item wsman:\localhost\client\trustedhosts -Value "dc1.xyz.com"
Y
```

Switches back to Management computer in a session to DC1 and tries to run a scriptblock
```
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Windows\Tasks> Invoke-Command -Computer ws01 -ScriptBlock { whoami }
```
It fails

Management computer in a session to DC1 and tries to run ping
```
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Windows\Tasks>  ping ws01
```
It works

---
Back to WS01

Tries using the IP address of DC1
```
PS C:\Windows\local_admin> set-item wsman:\localhost\client\trustedhosts -Value "192.168.175.155"
```
This also fails

---
Switches directly Management computer in a session to DC1
```
[192.168.175.155]: PS C:\Windows\Tasks> Invoke-Command -Computer ws01 -ScriptBlock { whoami }
```
This also fails

---
Switches to be direcly on DC1
```
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Invoke-Command -Computer ws01 -ScriptBlock { whoami }
```
This works

But still can't do it from Management via session

Tries to "Remove-PSSession" ID 1

Tries to create a new session
Still doesnt work

---
Now at 12:36 in the video, Here is where John goes off on a tangent to create ws02 based on snapshot of ws01, he has problems

The "force was not with him" ... "awful idea" as he mentioned

Jim's best advice is to just create a ws02 from our "base win11" 

Then just do the name change directly on WS02 and domain join it

Now at 27:00 in the video, John finally gets things working

---

Must have winrm running on ws01 and ws02 for the below to work (Start-Service WinRM)
- Need to go back to WS01, and WS02 and do a (Start-Service WinRM)

Switches directly to DC1
```
PS C:\User\Administator> Invoke-Command -Computer ws01 -ScriptBlock { ipconfig }
PS C:\User\Administator> Invoke-Command -Computer ws02 -ScriptBlock { ipconfig }
```
All good now

However we still can't do the scriptblock from Management to DC1

---
Therefore, John concludes we must direcly run the "gen_ad.ps" script on the DC1 itself !!!

Finally at 30:00 in the video - back to the "gen_ad.ps1" script modifications

Reminder, we are using "ad_schema.json" as input to "gen_ad.ps1" direcly on DC1
```
PS C:\Window\Tasks> .\gen_ad.ps1 .\ad_schema.json
```

John takes until 44:18 in the video to complete the changes to support "local_admins" on each Workstatuon (WS01, WS02, ...)

All is well!
